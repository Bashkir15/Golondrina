						<p>This is going to be quite a bit of text about Golondrina Studios, where they came from, what their mission is, and how they plan to accomplish it. It might have a quote or something silly like that, or it might have a ton of other goodies that I haven't thought of yet. This is pretty much going to be the base design for all of the work that I have to do on this page that I really don't feel like doing. I hope I can make this look okay enough to not matter thaaaaat much. Getting tired and bored of making these pages, and I would like to get on with doing something else, pls.</p>
